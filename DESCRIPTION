Description: The Datasaurus Dozen is a set of datasets with the same summary statistics. They 
             retain the same summary statistics despite having radically different distributions.
             The datasets represent a larger and quirkier object lesson that is typically taught
             via Anscombe's Quartet (available in the 'datasets' package). Anscombe's Quartet
             contains four very different distributions with the same summary statistics and as 
             such highlights the value of visualisation in understanding data, over and above
             summary statistics. As well as being an engaging variant on the Quartet, the data
             is generated in a novel way. The simulated annealing process used to derive datasets 
             from the original Datasaurus is detailed in "Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating 
             Datasets with Varied Appearance and Identical Statistics through Simulated Annealing"
